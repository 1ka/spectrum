Spectrum is an Android library that makes it easy to let your user pick from a list of colors.

## Deploying to Bintray
First, make sure the project's information is configured correctly in the `ext` block in `spectrum/build.gradle`. Next, put your Bintray information in your `local.properties` file; you will need to define `bintray.user`, `bintray.apikey`, and `bintray.gpg.password`.

To deploy the artifacts, run the following commands. The first is a dry run to make sure the artifacts can be built correctly. The second actually deploys to Bintray.

```
./gradlew install
./gradlew bintray
```
